# Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror
In this project, I created a Smart Mirror using a Raspberry Pi 4. This device goes beyond the purpose of a normal mirror; it delivers updates on weather, news, art, and more, embedded subtly into the mirrorâ€™s code. In my portfolio, take a look at a mirror that not only you can admire yourself in, but update you on the world as well

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

- My second Milestone was to incorporate at least 3 third-party modules for my smart mirror. I did this by updating my config.js file.
- I had to pull clones of third-party modules from GitHub in order to add them to my mirror, and I am glad to report that it was a huge success.
- My main grief with this part of the project had to be the installation itself for the modules, because when I added them to my modules folder, the app for MagicMirror2, Electron, would not launch and instead blast me with errors.
- The solution for this was to install the modules on both the modules folder of the smart mirror as well as on the main MagicMirror software itself. After I did this, Electron resumed working and everything worked well.

# First Milestone

- My first milestone was to essentially just write the code in order to display the Magic Mirror. I managed to set up the code in order to display the default display of the Magic Mirror
- I had to install VScode in order to write this code as I do not have parts nor a Raspberry Pi as I write this because I am in Seoul, South Korea. Therefore, I am using a USB stick in order to house my Raspberry Pi OS, as well as a computer folder to house my code until my parts arrive.
- During this milestone, my main problem was finding out a solution in order to get a crucial part of the work finished even though I have no parts, and luckily I managed to run the software on my computer, leading to the completion of my first milestone.
- With this completion, I am starting to see that there are multiple ways to approach a rather unorthodox problem, and I hope I can keep solving these until the end.

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
